# Kernhook
just a nice name, idk why i put that name
also very glitchy, so i would recommend you to just keep reopening suspiciousips.txt file
# Kernwall
Its basically a ip blocker, insert a ip there to block, it already comes with Kernhook latest versions. You can find it on releases!

# How it works? 
Monitors new connections and warns you (ye this is it)
Open suspiciousip.txt to find
